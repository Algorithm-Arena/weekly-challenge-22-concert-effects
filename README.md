# Weekly Challenge #22 - Concert Effects

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that generates a visual effect that could be used in a concert.** There's a trend for music concerts to have interesting looking visual effects on giant screens, I keep thinking how cool it would be to be the person programming them, so this week's challenge is your opportunity to do so!
